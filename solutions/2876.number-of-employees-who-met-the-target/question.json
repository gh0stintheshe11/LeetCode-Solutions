Each employee i has worked for hours[i] hours in the company.\nThe company requires each employee to work for at least target hours.\nYou are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers hours of length n and a non-negative integer target.\nReturn the integer denoting the number of employees who worked at least target hours.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: hours = [0,1,2,3,4], target = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The company wants each employee to work for at least 2 hours.\n- Employee 0 worked for 0 hours and didn't meet the target.\n- Employee 1 worked for 1 hours and didn't meet the target.\n- Employee 2 worked for 2 hours and met the target.\n- Employee 3 worked for 3 hours and met the target.\n- Employee 4 worked for 4 hours and met the target.\nThere are 3 employees who met the target.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: hours = [5,1,4,2,2], target = 6\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The company wants each employee to work for at least 6 hours.\nThere are 0 employees who met the target.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == hours.length <= 50\n0 <= hours[i], target <= 105\n\n", "hints": ["Iterate over the elements of array hours and check if the value is greater than or equal to target."], "exampleTestcases": "[0,1,2,3,4]\n2\n[5,1,4,2,2]\n6", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(vector<int>& hours, int target) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int[] hours, int target) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(self, hours, target):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type hours: List[int]\n        :type target: int\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(self, hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int* hours, int hoursSize, int target){\n\n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public int NumberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(int[] hours, int target) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {number[]} hours\n * @param {number} target\n * @return {number}\n */\nvar numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget = function(hours, target) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours: number[], target: number): number {\n\n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param Integer[] $hours\n     * @param Integer $target\n     * @return Integer\n     */\n    function numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget($hours, $target) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(_ hours: [Int], _ target: Int) -> Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours: IntArray, target: Int): Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(List<int> hours, int target) {\n\n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours []int, target int) int {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {Integer[]} hours\n# @param {Integer} target\n# @return {Integer}\ndef number_of_employees_who_met_target(hours, target)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours: Array[Int], target: Int): Int = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn number_of_employees_who_met_target(hours: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> i32 {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (number-of-employees-who-met-target hours target)\n  (-> (listof exact-integer?) exact-integer? exact-integer?)\n\n  )"}, "Erlang": {"langSlug": "erlang", "code": "-spec number_of_employees_who_met_target(Hours :: [integer()], Target :: integer()) -> integer().\nnumber_of_employees_who_met_target(Hours, Target) ->\n  ."}, "Elixir": {"langSlug": "elixir", "code": "defmodule Solution do\n  @spec number_of_employees_who_met_target(hours :: [integer], target :: integer) :: integer\n  def number_of_employees_who_met_target(hours, target) do\n    \n  end\nend"}}}
