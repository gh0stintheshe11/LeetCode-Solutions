{"question_id": "3239", "problem_slug": "minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-x-and-y-equal", "problem_title": "Minimum Number of Operations to Make X and Y Equal", "content": "You are given two positive integers x and y.\nIn one operation, you can do one of the four following operations:\n\nDivide x by 11 if x is a multiple of 11.\nDivide x by 5 if x is a multiple of 5.\nDecrement x by 1.\nIncrement x by 1.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations required to make  x and y equal.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: x = 26, y = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can make 26 equal to 1 by applying the following operations: \n1. Decrement x by 1\n2. Divide x by 5\n3. Divide x by 5\nIt can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations required to make 26 equal to 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: x = 54, y = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We can make 54 equal to 2 by applying the following operations: \n1. Increment x by 1\n2. Divide x by 11 \n3. Divide x by 5\n4. Increment x by 1\nIt can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of operations required to make 54 equal to 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: x = 25, y = 30\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: We can make 25 equal to 30 by applying the following operations: \n1. Increment x by 1\n2. Increment x by 1\n3. Increment x by 1\n4. Increment x by 1\n5. Increment x by 1\nIt can be shown that 5 is the minimum number of operations required to make 25 equal to 30.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= x, y <= 104\n\n", "hints": ["The only way to make <code>x</code> larger is to increase it by <code>1</code> so if <code>y >= x</code> the answer is <code>y - x</code>.", "For <code>y < x</code>, <code>x - y</code> is always a candidate answer since we can repeatedly decrease <code>x</code> by one to reach <code>y</code>.", "We can also increase <code>x</code> and then use the division operations.
