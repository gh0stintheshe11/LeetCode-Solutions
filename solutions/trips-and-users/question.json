There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.\n  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.\n  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33\nOn 2013-10-02:\n  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00\nOn 2013-10-03:\n  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.\n  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50\n</pre>\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\": {\"Trips\": [\"id\", \"client_id\", \"driver_id\", \"city_id\", \"status\", \"request_at\"], \"Users\": [\"users_id\", \"banned\", \"role\"]}, \"rows\": {\"Trips\": [[\"1\", \"1\", \"10\", \"1\", \"completed\", \"2013-10-01\"], [\"2\", \"2\", \"11\", \"1\", \"cancelled_by_driver\", \"2013-10-01\"], [\"3\", \"3\", \"12\", \"6\", \"completed\", \"2013-10-01\"], [\"4\", \"4\", \"13\", \"6\", \"cancelled_by_client\", \"2013-10-01\"], [\"5\", \"1\", \"10\", \"1\", \"completed\", \"2013-10-02\"], [\"6\", \"2\", \"11\", \"6\", \"completed\", \"2013-10-02\"], [\"7\", \"3\", \"12\", \"6\", \"completed\", \"2013-10-02\"], [\"8\", \"2\", \"12\", \"12\", \"completed\", \"2013-10-03\"], [\"9\", \"3\", \"10\", \"12\", \"completed\", \"2013-10-03\"], [\"10\", \"4\", \"13\", \"12\", \"cancelled_by_driver\", \"2013-10-03\"]], \"Users\": [[\"1\", \"No\", \"client\"], [\"2\", \"Yes\", \"client\"], [\"3\", \"No\", \"client\"], [\"4\", \"No\", \"client\"], [\"10\", \"No\", \"driver\"], [\"11\", \"No\", \"driver\"], [\"12\", \"No\", \"driver\"], [\"13\", \"No\", \"driver\"]]}}", "codeSnippets": [{"lang": "MySQL", "langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, {"lang": "MS SQL Server", "langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Oracle", "langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Pandas", "langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef trips_and_users(trips: pd.DataFrame, users: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, {"lang": "PostgreSQL", "langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}], "similarQuestionList": [{"difficulty": "Hard", "titleSlug": "hopper-company-queries-i", "title": "Hopper Company Queries I", "isPaidOnly": true}, {"difficulty": "Hard", "titleSlug": "hopper-company-queries-ii", "title": "Hopper Company Queries II", "isPaidOnly": true}, {"difficulty": "Hard", "titleSlug": "hopper-company-queries-iii", "title": "Hopper Company Queries III", "isPaidOnly": true}]}
