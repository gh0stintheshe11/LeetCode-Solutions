{"question_id": "2553", "problem_slug": "total-cost-to-hire-k-workers", "problem_title": "Total Cost to Hire K Workers", "content": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the ith worker.\nYou are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:\n\nYou will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.\nIn each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.\n\t\nFor example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].\nIn the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.\n\n\nIf there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.\nA worker can only be chosen once.\n\nReturn the total cost to hire exactly k workers.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4\nOutput: 11\nExplanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.\n- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.\n- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.\n- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.\nThe total hiring cost is 11.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.\n- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.\n- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe total hiring cost is 4.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= costs.length <= 105 \n1 <= costs[i] <= 105\n1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length\n\n", "hints": ["Maintain two minheaps: one for the left and one for the right.", "Compare the top element from two heaps and remove the appropriate one.", "Add a new element to the heap and maintain its size as k."], "exampleTestcases": "[17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]\n3\n4\n[1,2,4,1]\n3\n3", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    long long totalCost(vector<int>& costs, int k, int candidates) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public long totalCost(int[] costs, int k, int candidates) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def totalCost(self, costs, k, candidates):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type costs: List[int]\n        :type k: int\n        :type candidates: int\n        :rtype: int\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def totalCost(self, costs: List[int], k: int, candidates: int) -> int:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "long long totalCost(int* costs, int costsSize, int k, int candidates) {\n    \n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public long TotalCost(int[] costs, int k, int candidates) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {number[]} costs\n * @param {number} k\n * @param {number} candidates\n * @return {number}\n */\nvar totalCost = function(costs, k, candidates) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function totalCost(costs: number[], k: number, candidates: number): number {\n    \n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param Integer[] $costs\n     * @param Integer $k\n     * @param Integer $candidates\n     * @return Integer\n     */\n    function totalCost($costs, $k, $candidates) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func totalCost(_ costs: [Int], _ k: Int, _ candidates: Int) -> Int {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun totalCost(costs: IntArray, k: Int, candidates: Int): Long {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  int totalCost(List<int> costs, int k, int candidates) {\n    \n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func totalCost(costs []int, k int, candidates int) int64 {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {Integer[]} costs\n# @param {Integer} k\n# @param {Integer} candidates\n# @return {Integer}\ndef total_cost(costs, k, candidates)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def totalCost(costs: Array[Int], k: Int, candidates: Int): Long = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn total_cost(costs: Vec<i32>, k: i32, candidates: i32) -> i64 {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (total-cost costs k candidates)\n  (-> (listof exact-integer?) exact-integer? exact-integer? exact-integer?)\n  )"}, "Erlang": {"langSlug": "erlang", "code": "-spec total_cost(Costs :: [integer()], K :: integer(), Candidates :: integer()) -> integer().\ntotal_cost(Costs, K, Candidates) ->\n  ."}, "Elixir": {"langSlug": "elixir", "code": "defmodule Solution do\n  @spec total_cost(costs :: [integer], k :: integer, candidates :: integer) :: integer\n  def total_cost(costs, k, candidates) do\n    \n  end\nend"}}}
