{"question_id": "1955", "problem_slug": "seat-reservation-manager", "problem_title": "Seat Reservation Manager", "content": "Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.\nImplement the SeatManager class:\n\nSeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to n. All seats are initially available.\nint reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.\nvoid unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"SeatManager\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"unreserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"reserve\", \"unreserve\"]\n[[5], [], [], [2], [], [], [], [], [5]]\nOutput\n[null, 1, 2, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null]\n\nExplanation\nSeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); // Initializes a SeatManager with 5 seats.\nseatManager.reserve();    // All seats are available, so return the lowest numbered seat, which is 1.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\nseatManager.unreserve(2); // Unreserve seat 2, so now the available seats are [2,3,4,5].\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [2,3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 2.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [3,4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 3.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The available seats are [4,5], so return the lowest of them, which is 4.\nseatManager.reserve();    // The only available seat is seat 5, so return 5.\nseatManager.unreserve(5); // Unreserve seat 5, so now the available seats are [5].\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 105\n1 <= seatNumber <= n\nFor each call to reserve, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.\nFor each call to unreserve, it is guaranteed that seatNumber will be reserved.\nAt most 105 calls in total will be made to reserve and unreserve.\n\n", "hints": ["You need a data structure that maintains the states of the seats.
