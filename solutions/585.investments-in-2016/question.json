It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.\nlon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.\n\n \nWrite a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:\n\nhave the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and\nare not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).\n\nRound tiv_2016 to two decimal places.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nInsurance table:\n+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+\n| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |\n+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+\n| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |\n| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |\n| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |\n| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |\n+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+\nOutput: \n+----------+\n| tiv_2016 |\n+----------+\n| 45.00    |\n+----------+\nExplanation: \nThe first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.\nThe tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.\n\nThe second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.\nSo, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.\n\n", "hints": ["Make the (LAT, LON) a pair to represent the location information"], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Insurance\":[\"pid\",\"tiv_2015\",\"tiv_2016\",\"lat\",\"lon\"]},\"rows\":{\"Insurance\":[[1,10,5,10,10],[2,20,20,20,20],[3,10,30,20,20],[4,10,40,40,40]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef find_investments(insurance: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
