The statistics should be built using the played matches where the <strong>winning</strong> team gets <strong>three points</strong> and the <strong>losing</strong> team gets <strong>no points</strong>.

If two or more teams have the same <code>points</code>, order them by <code>goal_diff</code> <strong>in descending order</strong>. If there is still a tie, order them by <code>team_name</code> in <strong>lexicographical order</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> \nTeams table:\n+---------+-----------+\n| team_id | team_name |\n+---------+-----------+\n| 1       | Ajax      |\n| 4       | Dortmund  |\n| 6       | Arsenal   |\n+---------+-----------+\nMatches table:\n+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n| home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |\n+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n| 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |\n| 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |\n| 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |\n| 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |\n+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+\n<strong>Output:</strong> \n+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+\n| team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against | goal_diff |\n+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+\n| Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4         |\n| Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0         |\n| Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4        |\n+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> \nAjax (team_id=1) played 4 matches: 2 losses and 2 draws.
