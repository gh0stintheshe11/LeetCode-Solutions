{"question_id": "3107", "problem_slug": "maximum-spending-after-buying-items", "problem_title": "Maximum Spending After Buying Items", "content": "You are given a 0-indexed m * n integer matrix values, representing the values of m * n different items in m different shops. Each shop has n items where the jth item in the ith shop has a value of values[i][j]. Additionally, the items in the ith shop are sorted in non-increasing order of value. That is, values[i][j] >= values[i][j + 1] for all 0 <= j < n - 1.\nOn each day, you would like to buy a single item from one of the shops. Specifically, On the dth day you can:\n\nPick any shop i.\nBuy the rightmost available item j for the price of values[i][j] * d. That is, find the greatest index j such that item j was never bought before, and buy it for the price of values[i][j] * d.\n\nNote that all items are pairwise different. For example, if you have bought item 0 from shop 1, you can still buy item 0 from any other shop.\nReturn the maximum amount of money that can be spent on buying all  m * n products.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: values = [[8,5,2],[6,4,1],[9,7,3]]\nOutput: 285\nExplanation: On the first day, we buy product 2 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][2] * 1 = 1.\nOn the second day, we buy product 2 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][2] * 2 = 4.\nOn the third day, we buy product 2 from shop 2 for a price of values[2][2] * 3 = 9.\nOn the fourth day, we buy product 1 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][1] * 4 = 16.\nOn the fifth day, we buy product 1 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][1] * 5 = 25.\nOn the sixth day, we buy product 0 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][0] * 6 = 36.\nOn the seventh day, we buy product 1 from shop 2 for a price of values[2][1] * 7 = 49.\nOn the eighth day, we buy product 0 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][0] * 8 = 64.\nOn the ninth day, we buy product 0 from shop 2 for a price of values[2][0] * 9 = 81.\nHence, our total spending is equal to 285.\nIt can be shown that 285 is the maximum amount of money that can be spent buying all m * n products. \n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: values = [[10,8,6,4,2],[9,7,5,3,2]]\nOutput: 386\nExplanation: On the first day, we buy product 4 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][4] * 1 = 2.\nOn the second day, we buy product 4 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][4] * 2 = 4.\nOn the third day, we buy product 3 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][3] * 3 = 9.\nOn the fourth day, we buy product 3 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][3] * 4 = 16.\nOn the fifth day, we buy product 2 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][2] * 5 = 25.\nOn the sixth day, we buy product 2 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][2] * 6 = 36.\nOn the seventh day, we buy product 1 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][1] * 7 = 49.\nOn the eighth day, we buy product 1 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][1] * 8 = 64\nOn the ninth day, we buy product 0 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][0] * 9 = 81.\nOn the tenth day, we buy product 0 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][0] * 10 = 100.\nHence, our total spending is equal to 386.\nIt can be shown that 386 is the maximum amount of money that can be spent buying all m * n products.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= m == values.length <= 10\n1 <= n == values[i].length <= 104\n1 <= values[i][j] <= 106\nvalues[i] are sorted in non-increasing order.\n\n", "hints": ["Iterate on days <code>1</code> to <code>m * n</code>.", "On each day, buy the product that minimizes <code>values[i][values[i].length -
