{"question_id": "398", "problem_slug": "random-pick-index", "problem_title": "Random Pick Index", "content": "Given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.\nImplement the Solution class:\n\nSolution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the array nums.\nint pick(int target) Picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput\n[\"Solution\", \"pick\", \"pick\", \"pick\"]\n[[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]], [3], [1], [3]]\nOutput\n[null, 4, 0, 2]\n\nExplanation\nSolution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);\nsolution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.\nsolution.pick(1); // It should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.\nsolution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104\n-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1\ntarget is an integer from nums.\nAt most 104 calls will be made to pick.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "[\"Solution\",\"pick\",\"pick\",\"pick\"]\n[[[1,2,3,3,3]],[3],[1],[3]]", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n
