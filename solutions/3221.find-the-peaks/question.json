{"question_id": "3221", "problem_slug": "find-the-peaks", "problem_title": "Find the Peaks", "content": "You are given a 0-indexed array mountain. Your task is to find all the peaks in the mountain array.\nReturn an array that consists of indices of peaks in the given array in any order.\nNotes:\n\nA peak is defined as an element that is strictly greater than its neighboring elements.\nThe first and last elements of the array are not a peak.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: mountain = [2,4,4]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: mountain[0] and mountain[2] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.\nmountain[1] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[2].\nSo the answer is [].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mountain = [1,4,3,8,5]\nOutput: [1,3]\nExplanation: mountain[0] and mountain[4] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.\nmountain[2] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[3] and mountain[1].\nBut mountain [1] and mountain[3] are strictly greater than their neighboring elements.\nSo the answer is [1,3].\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n3 <= mountain.length <= 100\n1 <= mountain[i] <= 100\n\n", "hints": ["If <code>nums[i] > num[i - 1]</code> and <code>nums[i] > nums[i + 1]</code> <code>nums[i]</code> is a peak."], "exampleTestcases": "[2,4,4]\n[1,4,3,8,5]", "codeSnippets": {"C++": {"langSlug": "cpp", "code": "class Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> findPeaks(vector<int>& mountain) {\n        \n    }\n};"}, "Java": {"langSlug": "java", "code": "class Solution {\n    public List<Integer> findPeaks(int[] mountain) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Python": {"langSlug": "python", "code": "class Solution(object):\n    def findPeaks(self, mountain):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type mountain: List[int]\n        :rtype: List[int]\n        \"\"\"\n        "}, "Python3": {"langSlug": "python3", "code": "class Solution:\n    def findPeaks(self, mountain: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        "}, "C": {"langSlug": "c", "code": "/**\n * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().\n */\nint* findPeaks(int* mountain, int mountainSize, int* returnSize) {\n    \n}"}, "C#": {"langSlug": "csharp", "code": "public class Solution {\n    public IList<int> FindPeaks(int[] mountain) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "JavaScript": {"langSlug": "javascript", "code": "/**\n * @param {number[]} mountain\n * @return {number[]}\n */\nvar findPeaks = function(mountain) {\n    \n};"}, "TypeScript": {"langSlug": "typescript", "code": "function findPeaks(mountain: number[]): number[] {\n    \n};"}, "PHP": {"langSlug": "php", "code": "class Solution {\n\n    /**\n     * @param Integer[] $mountain\n     * @return Integer[]\n     */\n    function findPeaks($mountain) {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Swift": {"langSlug": "swift", "code": "class Solution {\n    func findPeaks(_ mountain: [Int]) -> [Int] {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Kotlin": {"langSlug": "kotlin", "code": "class Solution {\n    fun findPeaks(mountain: IntArray): List<Int> {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Dart": {"langSlug": "dart", "code": "class Solution {\n  List<int> findPeaks(List<int> mountain) {\n    \n  }\n}"}, "Go": {"langSlug": "golang", "code": "func findPeaks(mountain []int) []int {\n    \n}"}, "Ruby": {"langSlug": "ruby", "code": "# @param {Integer[]} mountain\n# @return {Integer[]}\ndef find_peaks(mountain)\n    \nend"}, "Scala": {"langSlug": "scala", "code": "object Solution {\n    def findPeaks(mountain: Array[Int]): List[Int] = {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Rust": {"langSlug": "rust", "code": "impl Solution {\n    pub fn find_peaks(mountain: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {\n        \n    }\n}"}, "Racket": {"langSlug": "racket", "code": "(define/contract (find-peaks mountain)\n  (-> (listof exact-integer?)
