Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a single entry is out_time - in_time.\nReturn the result table in any order.\nThe result format is in the following example.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nEmployees table:\n+--------+------------+---------+----------+\n| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |\n+--------+------------+---------+----------+\n| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |\n| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |\n| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |\n| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |\n| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |\n+--------+------------+---------+----------+\nOutput: \n+------------+--------+------------+\n| day        | emp_id | total_time |\n+------------+--------+------------+\n| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |\n| 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |\n| 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |\n| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |\n+------------+--------+------------+\nExplanation: \nEmployee 1 has three events: two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (32 - 4) + (200 - 55) = 173, and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total of (42 - 1) = 41.\nEmployee 2 has two events: one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (33 - 3) = 30, and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.\n\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Employees\":[\"emp_id\",\"event_day\",\"in_time\",\"out_time\"]},\"rows\":{\"Employees\":[[\"1\",\"2020-11-28\",\"4\",\"32\"],[\"1\",\"2020-11-28\",\"55\",\"200\"],[\"1\",\"2020-12-3\",\"1\",\"42\"],[\"2\",\"2020-11-28\",\"3\",\"33\"],[\"2\",\"2020-12-9\",\"47\",\"74\"]]}}", "codeSnippets": {"MySQL": {"langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, "MS SQL Server": {"langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Oracle": {"langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, "Pandas": {"langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef total_time(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, "PostgreSQL": {"langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}}}
