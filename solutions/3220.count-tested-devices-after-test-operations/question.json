{"question_id": "3220", "problem_slug": "count-tested-devices-after-test-operations", "problem_title": "Count Tested Devices After Test Operations", "content": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.\nYour task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing the following test operations:\n\nIf batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:\n\n\t\nIncrement the count of tested devices.\nDecrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).\nMove to the next device.\n\n\nOtherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.\n\nReturn an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: batteryPercentages = [1,1,2,1,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:\nAt device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].\nAt device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.\nAt device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].\nAt device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.\nAt device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.\nSo, the answer is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: batteryPercentages = [0,1,2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:\nAt device 0, batteryPercentages[0] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.\nAt device 1, batteryPercentages[1] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [0,1,1].\nAt device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.\nSo, the answer is 2.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == batteryPercentages.length <= 100 \n0 <= batteryPercentages[i] <= 100\n\n", "hints": ["One solution is simulating the operations as explained in the problem statement, and it works in
