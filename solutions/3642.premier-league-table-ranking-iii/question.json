The ranking should be determined as follows:\n\nTeams are first ranked by their total points (highest to lowest)\nIf points are tied, teams are then ranked by their goal difference (highest to lowest)\nIf goal difference is also tied, teams are then ranked alphabetically by team name\n\nPoints are calculated as follows:\n\n3 points for a win\n1 point for a draw\n0 points for a loss\n\nGoal difference is calculated as: goals_for - goals_against\nReturn the result table ordered by season_id in ascending order, then by rank in ascending order, and finally by team_name in ascending order.\nThe query result format is in the following example.\n \nExample:\nInput:\nSeasonStats table:\n\n+------------+---------+-------------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+-----------+---------------+\n| season_id  | team_id | team_name         | matches_played | wins | draws | losses | goals_for | goals_against |\n+------------+---------+-------------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+-----------+---------------+\n| 2021       | 1       | Manchester City   | 38             | 29   | 6     | 3      | 99        | 26            |\n| 2021       | 2       | Liverpool         | 38             | 28   | 8     | 2      | 94        | 26            |\n| 2021       | 3       | Chelsea           | 38             | 21   | 11    | 6      | 76        | 33            |\n| 2021       | 4       | Tottenham         | 38             | 22   | 5     | 11     | 69        | 40            |\n| 2021       | 5       | Arsenal           | 38             | 22   | 3     | 13     | 61        | 48            |\n| 2022       | 1       | Manchester City   | 38             | 28   | 5     | 5      | 94        | 33            |\n| 2022       | 2       | Arsenal           | 38             | 26   | 6     | 6      | 88        | 43            |\n| 2022       | 3       | Manchester United | 38             | 23   | 6     | 9      | 58        | 43            |\n| 2022       | 4       | Newcastle         | 38             | 19   | 14    | 5      | 68        | 33            |\n| 2022       | 5       | Liverpool         | 38             | 19   | 10    | 9      | 75        | 47            |\n+------------+---------+-------------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+-----------+---------------+\n\nOutput:\n\n+------------+---------+-------------------+--------+-----------------+----------+\n| season_id  | team_id | team_name         | points | goal_difference | position |\n+------------+---------+-------------------+--------+-----------------+----------+\n| 2021       | 1       | Manchester City   | 93     | 73              | 1        |\n| 2021       | 2       | Liverpool         | 92     | 68              | 2        |\n| 2021       | 3       | Chelsea           | 74     | 43              | 3        |\n| 2021       | 4       | Tottenham         | 71     | 29              | 4        |\n| 2021       | 5       | Arsenal           | 69     | 13              | 5        |\n| 2022       | 1       | Manchester City   | 89     | 61              | 1        |\n| 2022       | 2       | Arsenal           | 84     | 45              | 2        |\n| 2022       | 3       | Manchester United | 75     | 15              | 3        |\n| 2022       | 4       | Newcastle         | 71     | 35              | 4        |\n| 2022       | 5       | Liverpool         | 67     | 28              | 5        | \n+------------+---------+-------------------+--------+-----------------+----------+\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor the 2021 season:\n\t\nManchester City has 93 points (29 * 3 + 6 * 1) and a goal difference of 73 (99 -
