Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.\nHandbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.\nCorona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each (&#39;Buy&#39; --&gt; &#39;Sell&#39;) operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.\n</pre>\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Stocks\":[\"stock_name\",\"operation\",\"operation_day\",\"price\"]},\"rows\":{\"Stocks\":[[\"Leetcode\",\"Buy\",1,1000],[\"Corona Masks\",\"Buy\",2,10],[\"Leetcode\",\"Sell\",5,9000],[\"Handbags\",\"Buy\",17,30000],[\"Corona Masks\",\"Sell\",3,1010],[\"Corona Masks\",\"Buy\",4,1000],[\"Corona Masks\",\"Sell\",5,500],[\"Corona Masks\",\"Buy\",6,1000],[\"Handbags\",\"Sell\",29,7000],[\"Corona Masks\",\"Sell\",10,10000]]}}", "codeSnippets": [{"lang": "MySQL", "langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, {"lang": "MS SQL Server", "langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Oracle", "langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Pandas", "langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef capital_gainloss(stocks: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, {"lang": "PostgreSQL", "langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}], "similarQuestionList": []}
