If there are multiple score values satisfying the above conditions, choose the <strong>smallest</strong> one.

Choosing 975 as the min score requirement, the school will get at most 10 applications, which is within capacity.\n- School 10: The school&#39;s capacity is 99. Choosing 844 or 749 as the min score requirement, the school will get at most 76 applications, which is within capacity. We choose the smallest of them, which is 749.\n- School 11: The school&#39;s capacity is 151. Choosing 744 as the min score requirement, the school will get at most 100 applications, which is within capacity.\n- School 9: The data given is not enough to determine the min score requirement. Choosing 975 as the min score, the school may get 10 requests while its capacity is 9. We do not have information about higher scores, hence we report -1.\n</pre>\n", "hints": [], "exampleTestcases": "{\"headers\":{\"Schools\":[\"school_id\",\"capacity\"],\"Exam\":[\"score\",\"student_count\"]},\"rows\":{\"Schools\":[[11,151],[5,48],[9,9],[10,99]],\"Exam\":[[975,10],[966,60],[844,76],[749,76],[744,100]]}}", "codeSnippets": [{"lang": "MySQL", "langSlug": "mysql", "code": "# Write your MySQL query statement below\n"}, {"lang": "MS SQL Server", "langSlug": "mssql", "code": "/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Oracle", "langSlug": "oraclesql", "code": "/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */\n"}, {"lang": "Pandas", "langSlug": "pythondata", "code": "import pandas as pd\n\ndef find_cutoff_score(schools: pd.DataFrame, exam: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    "}, {"lang": "PostgreSQL", "langSlug": "postgresql", "code": "-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below\n"}], "similarQuestionList": []}
